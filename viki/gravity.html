<b> Gravity </b><br>
<p>Nearly every child knows of the word gravity. Gravity is the name associated with the mishaps of the milk spilled from the breakfast table to the kitchen floor and the youngster who topples to the pavement as the grand finale of the first bicycle ride. Gravity is the name associated with the reason for "what goes up, must come down," whether it be the baseball hit in the neighborhood sandlot game or the child happily jumping on the backyard mini-trampoline. We all know of the word gravity - it is the thing that causes objects to fall to Earth. Yet the role of physics is to do more than to associate words with phenomenon. The role of physics is to explain phenomenon in terms of underlying principles. The goal is to explain phenomenon in terms of principles that are so universal that they are capable of explaining more than a single phenomenon but a wealth of phenomenon in a consistent manner. Thus, a student's conception of gravity must grow in sophistication to the point that it becomes more than a mere name associated with falling phenomenon. Gravity must be understood in terms of its cause, its source, and its far-reaching implications on the structure and the motion of the objects in the universe.
<p>
Certainly gravity is a force that exists between the Earth and the objects that are near it. As you stand upon the Earth, you experience this force. We have become accustomed to calling it the force of gravity and have even represented it by the symbol F<sub>grav</sub> It is the same acceleration value for all objects, regardless of their mass (and assuming that the only significant force is gravity). Many students of physics progress this far in their understanding of the notion of gravity. Most students of physics progress at least to this level of sophistication concerning the notion of gravity. This same force of gravity acts upon our bodies as we jump upwards from the Earth. As we rise upwards after our jump, the force of gravity slows us down. And as we fall back to Earth after reaching the peak of our motion, the force of gravity speeds us up. In this sense, the force gravity causes an acceleration of our bodies during this brief trip away from the earth's surface and back. In fact, many students of physics have become accustomed to referring to the actual acceleration of such an object as the acceleration of gravity. Not to be confused with the force of gravity (F<sub>grav</sub>), the acceleration of gravity (g) is the acceleration experienced by an object when the only force acting upon it is the force of gravity. On and near Earth's surface, the value for the acceleration of gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s/s. It is the same acceleration value for all objects, regardless of their mass (and assuming that the only significant force is gravity). Many students of physics progress this far in their understanding of the notion of gravity.

<br><b> The apple,the moon and the inverse square law </b>
<p>Of course, Newton's dilemma was to provide reasonable evidence for the extension of the force of gravity from earth to the heavens. The key to this extension demanded that he be able to show how the affect of gravity is diluted with distance. It was known at the time, that the force of gravity causes earthbound objects (such as falling apples) to accelerate towards the earth at a rate of 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. And it was also known that the moon accelerated towards the earth at a rate of 0.00272 m/s<sup>2</sup>. If the same force that causes the acceleration of the apple to the earth also causes the acceleration of the moon towards the earth, then there must be a plausible explanation for why the acceleration of the moon is so much smaller than the acceleration of the apple. What is it about the force of gravity that causes the more distant moon to accelerate at a rate of acceleration that is approximately 1/3600<sup>th</sup> the acceleration of the apple?
<p> <img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circles/u6l3b3.gif"></p>
</p>
<p>Newton knew that the force of gravity must somehow be "diluted" by distance. But how? What mathematical reality is intrinsic to the force of gravity that causes it to be inversely dependent upon the distance between the objects?
</p>
<p>The riddle is solved by a comparison of the distance from the apple to the center of the earth with the distance from the moon to the center of the earth. The moon in its orbit about the earth is approximately 60 times further from the earth's center than the apple is. The mathematical relationship becomes clear. The force of gravity between the earth and any object is inversely proportional to the square of the distance that separates that object from the earth's center. The moon, being 60 times further away than the apple, experiences a force of gravity that is 1/(60)<sup>2</sup> times that of the apple. The force of gravity follows an inverse square law.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circles/u6l3b4.gif"></p>

 
<p>
The relationship between the force of gravity (F<sub>grav</sub>) between the earth and any other object and the distance that separates their centers (d) can be expressed by the following relationship
<p><center><img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circles/u6l3b5.gif"></center></p>
</p>
<p>Since the distance d is in the denominator of this relationship, it can be said that the force of gravity is inversely related to the distance. And since the distance is raised to the second power, it can be said that the force of gravity is inversely related to the square of the distance. This mathematical relationship is sometimes referred to as an inverse square law since one quantity depends inversely upon the square of the other quantity. The inverse square relation between the force of gravity and the distance of separation provided sufficient evidence for Newton's explanation of why gravity can be credited as the cause of both the falling apple's acceleration and the orbiting moon's acceleration.
</p><br>
<b> Universal gravitational constant</b>
<p>Isaac Newton compared the acceleration of the moon to the acceleration of objects on earth. Believing that gravitational forces were responsible for each, Newton was able to draw an important conclusion about the dependence of gravity upon distance. This comparison led him to conclude that the force of gravitational attraction between the Earth and other objects is inversely proportional to the distance separating the earth's center from the object's center. But distance is not the only variable affecting the magnitude of a gravitational force. Consider Newton's famous equation
 </p>
<center>Fnet = m • a</center>

<p>Newton knew that the force that caused the apple's acceleration (gravity) must be dependent upon the mass of the apple. And since the force acting to cause the apple's downward acceleration also causes the earth's upward acceleration (Newton's third law), that force must also depend upon the mass of the earth. So for Newton, the force of gravity acting between the earth and any other object is directly proportional to the mass of the earth, directly proportional to the mass of the object, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance that separates the centers of the earth and the object.</p>
<p>
But Newton's law of universal gravitation extends gravity beyond earth. Newton's law of universal gravitation is about the universality of gravity. Newton's place in the Gravity Hall of Fame is not due to his discovery of gravity, but rather due to his discovery that gravitation is universal. ALL objects attract each other with a force of gravitational attraction. Gravity is universal. This force of gravitational attraction is directly dependent upon the masses of both objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance that separates their centers. Newton's conclusion about the magnitude of gravitational forces is summarized symbolically as</p>

<b> Cavendish and the Value of G </b>
<p>Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation proposed that the gravitational attraction between any two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. In equation form, this is often expressed as follows:
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circles/u6l3d1.gif"> </p>
</p><p>
The constant of proportionality in this equation is G - the universal gravitation constant. The value of G was not experimentally determined until nearly a century later (1798) by Lord Henry Cavendish using a torsion balance.
</p><p>
Cavendish's apparatus for experimentally determining the value of G involved a light, rigid rod about 2-feet long. Two small lead spheres were attached to the ends of the rod and the rod was suspended by a thin wire. When the rod becomes twisted, the torsion of the wire begins to exert a torsional force that is proportional to the angle of rotation of the rod. The more twist of the wire, the more the system pushes backwards to restore itself towards the original position. Cavendish had calibrated his instrument to determine the relationship between the angle of rotation and the amount of torsional force. A diagram of the apparatus is shown below.
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circles/u6l3d2.gif"></p>
</p><p>
Cavendish then brought two large lead spheres near the smaller spheres attached to the rod. Since all masses attract, the large spheres exerted a gravitational force upon the smaller spheres and twisted the rod a measurable amount. Once the torsional force balanced the gravitational force, the rod and spheres came to rest and Cavendish was able to determine the gravitational force of attraction between the masses. By measuring m1, m2, d and Fgrav, the value of G could be determined. Cavendish's measurements resulted in an experimentally determined value of 6.75 x 10<sup>-11</sup> N m<sup>2</sup>/kg<sup>2</sup>. Today, the currently accepted value is 6.67259 x 10<sup>-11</sup> N m<sup>2</sup>/kg<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
 The value of G is an extremely small numerical value. Its smallness accounts for the fact that the force of gravitational attraction is only appreciable for objects with large mass. While two students will indeed exert gravitational forces upon each other, these forces are too small to be noticeable. Yet if one of the students is replaced with a planet, then the gravitational force between the other student and the planet becomes noticeable.
<br>
<b> Value of g</b>
<p> An equation was given for determining the force of gravity (Fgrav) with which an object of mass m was attracted to the earth
</p> 
Fgrav = m*g
<p>
Now in this unit, a second equation has been introduced for calculating the force of gravity with which an object is attracted to the earth.
<center><img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circles/u6l3e1.gif"></center>
</p>
where d represents the distance from the center of the object to the center of the earth.
<p>
In the first equation above, g is referred to as the acceleration of gravity. Its value is 9.8 m/s2 on Earth. That is to say, the acceleration of gravity on the surface of the earth at sea level is 9.8 m/s2. When discussing the acceleration of gravity, it was mentioned that the value of g is dependent upon location. There are slight variations in the value of g about earth's surface. These variations result from the varying density of the geologic structures below each specific surface location. They also result from the fact that the earth is not truly spherical; the earth's surface is further from its center at the equator than it is at the poles. This would result in larger g values at the poles. As one proceeds further from earth's surface - say into a location of orbit about the earth - the value of g changes still.
</p><p>
To understand why the value of g is so location dependent, we will use the two equations above to derive an equation for the value of g. First, both expressions for the force of gravity are set equal to each other.
<center> <img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circles/u6l3e2.gif"></center>
</p><p>
Now observe that the mass of the object - m - is present on both sides of the equal sign. Thus, m can be canceled from the equation. This leaves us with an equation for the acceleration of gravity.
<center><img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circles/u6l3e3.gif"></center></p><p>
The above equation demonstrates that the acceleration of gravity is dependent upon the mass of the earth (approx. 5.98x1024 kg) and the distance (d) that an object is from the center of the earth. If the value 6.38x106 m (a typical earth radius value) is used for the distance from Earth's center, then g will be calculated to be 9.8 m/s2. And of course, the value of g will change as an object is moved further from Earth's center. For instance, if an object were moved to a location that is two earth-radii from the center of the earth - that is, two times 6.38x106 m - then a significantly different value of g will be found. As shown below, at twice the distance from the center of the earth, the value of g becomes 2.45 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
