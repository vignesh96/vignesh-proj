<td> Science is both a set of insights about the nature of the universe we live in, and a tool for developing further insights. This section of our web site contains a set of resources developed by SII staff and associates to help provide guidance and information for your efforts to incorporate the insights and process of science into your worldview-building process.<p> Although the ideas expressed in these resources do not necessarily reflect the ideas and positions of SII, you may find them helpful in your process of incorporating insights from science into your worldview. This section is (and will always be!) a work in progress. We'll continue developing this page and its links, as our resources permit. If you have suggestions or would like to help develop some of the materials, please contact us. <p>Meanwhile use these resources to follow your own path through the information you need to help you develop your own answers to questions about your role in the universe.
