<br><b> Basic model of the atom</b>
<center> <img src="http://0.tqn.com/d/chemistry/1/G/w/2/1/helium-atom.jpg"></center>
<p>All matter consists of particles called atoms. This is a list of the basic characteristics of atoms:
<ul type=disc>
<li>    Atoms cannot be divided using chemicals. They do consist of parts, which include protons, neutrons, and electrons, but an atom is a basic chemical building block of matter.</li>
<li>    Each electron has a negative electrical charge.</li>
<li>    Each proton has a positive electrical charge. The charge of a proton and an electron are equal in magnitude, yet opposite in sign. Electrons and protons are electrically attracted to each other.</li>
<li>    Each neutron is electrically neutral. In other words, neutrons do not have a charge and are not electrically attracted to either electrons or protons.</li>
<li>    Protons and neutrons are about the same size as each other and are much larger than electrons. The mass of a proton is essentially the same as that of a neutron. The mass of a proton is 1840 times greater than the mass of an electron.</li>
<li>    The nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons. The nucleus carries a positive electrical charge.</li>
<li>    Electrons move around outside the nucleus.</li>
<li>    Almost all of the mass of an atom is in its nucleus; almost all of the volume of an atom is occupied by electrons.</li>
<li>    The number of protons (also known as its atomic number) determines the element. Varying the number of neutrons results in isotopes. Varying the number of electrons results in ions. Isotopes and ions of an atom with a constant number of protons are all variations of a single element.</li>
<li>    The particles within an atom are bound together by powerful forces. In general, electrons are easier to add or remove from an atom than a proton or neutron. Chemical reactions largely involve atoms or groups of atoms and the interactions between their electrons. </li>
</ul>

<b> Bohr's Atom model</b>
<center><img src="http://0.tqn.com/d/chemistry/1/G/g/y/bohr-model.jpg"></center>
<p>The Bohr Model has an atom consisting of a small, positively-charged nucleus orbited by negatively-charged electrons. Here's a closer look at the Bohr Model, which is sometimes called the Rutherford-Bohr Model.</p>
<p>Niels Bohr proposed the Bohr Model of the Atom in 1915. Because the Bohr Model is a modification of the earlier Rutherford Model, some people call Bohr's Model the Rutherford-Bohr Model. The modern model of the atom is based on quantum mechanics. The Bohr Model contains some errors, but it is important because it describes most of the accepted features of atomic theory without all of the high-level math of the modern version. Unlike earlier models, the Bohr Model explains the Rydberg formula for the spectral emission lines of atomic hydrogen.</p>

<p>The Bohr Model is a planetary model in which the negatively-charged electrons orbit a small, positively-charged nucleus similar to the planets orbiting the Sun (except that the orbits are not planar). The gravitational force of the solar system is mathematically akin to the Coulomb (electrical) force between the positively-charged nucleus and the negatively-charged electrons.</p>

<b>Main Points of the Bohr Model</b>
<ul>
 <li>   Electrons orbit the nucleus in orbits that have a set size and energy.</li>
<li>    The energy of the orbit is related to its size. The lowest energy is found in the smallest orbit.</li>
<li>    Radiation is absorbed or emitted when an electron moves from one orbit to another. </li>
</ul>
<b>Bohr Model of Hydrogen</b>
<p>The simplest example of the Bohr Model is for the hydrogen atom (Z = 1) or for a hydrogen-like ion (Z > 1), in which a negatively-charged electron orbits a small positively-charged nucleus. Electromagnetic energy will be absorbed or emitted if an electron moves from one orbit to another. Only certain electron orbits are permitted. The radius of the possible orbits increases as n2, where n is the principal quantum number. The 3 ? 2 transition produces the first line of the Balmer series. For hydrogen (Z = 1) this produces a photon having wavelength 656 nm (red light).</p>
Problems with the Bohr Model

<ul>
<li>    It violates the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle because it considers electrons to have both a known radius and orbit.</li>
<li>    The Bohr Model provides an incorrect value for the ground state orbital angular momentum.</li>
 <li>   It makes poor predictions regarding the spectra of larger atoms.</li>
 <li>It does not predict the relative intensities of spectral lines.</li>
<li>The Bohr Model does not explain fine structure and hyperfine structure in spectral lines.</li>
 <li>   It does not explain the Zeeman Effect. </li>
</ul>

<b> Molecules and Moles </b>
<p>A molecule is a combination of two or more atoms that are held together by chemical bonds, such as covalent bonds and ionic bonds. A molecule is the smallest unit of a compound that still displays the properties associated with that compound. Molecules may contain two atoms of the same element, such as O2 and H2, or they may consist of two or more different atoms, such as CCl4 and H2O. In the study of chemistry, molecules are usually discussed in terms of their molecular weights and moles.</p>

<p>Ionic compounds, such as NaCl and KBr, do not form traditional discrete molecules like those formed by covalent bonds. In their solid state, these substances form a three-dimensional array of charged particles. In such a case, molecular weight has no meaning, so the term formula weight is used instead.</p>

<b>Molecular Weight and Formula Weight</b>

<p>The molecular weight of a molecule is calculated by adding the atomic weights (in atomic mass units or amu) of the atoms in the molecule. The formula weight of an ionic compound is calculated by adding its atomic weights according to its empirical formula.</p>

<b>The Mole</b>

<p>A mole is defined as the quantity of a substance that has the same number of particles as are found in 12.000 grams of carbon-12. This number, Avogadro's number, is 6.022x1023. The mass in grams of one mole of a compound is equal to the molecular weight of the compound in atomic mass units. One mole of a compound contains 6.022x1023 molecules of the compound. The mass of 1 mole of a compound is called its molar weight or molar mass. The units for molar weight or molar mass are grams per mole. Here is the formula for determining the number of moles of a sample:</p>

<center><em>mol = weight of sample (g) / molar weight (g/mol)</em></center>

<b> Introduction to Molecular Geometry </b>
<p>
Molecular geometry or molecular structure is the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms within a molecule. It is important to be able to predict and understand the molecular structure of a molecule because many of the properties of a substance are determined by its geometry.</p>
<br><b>The Valence Shell, Bonding Pairs, and VSEPR Model</b>
<center><img src="http://0.tqn.com/d/chemistry/1/G/3/u/lineargeometry.jpg"></center>
<p>The outermost electrons of an atom are its valence electrons. The valence electrons are the electrons that are most often involved in forming bonds and making molecules.</p>

<p>Pairs of electrons are shared between atoms in a molecule and hold the atoms together. These pairs are called "bonding pairs".</p>

One way to predict the way electrons within atoms will repel each other is to apply the VSEPR (valence-shell electron-pair repulsion) model. VSEPR can be used to determine a molecule's general geometry.
<br><br><b>Predicting Molecular Geometry</b>
<p>Here is a chart that describes the usual geometry for molecules based on their bonding behavior. To use this key, first draw out the Lewis structure for a molecule. Count how many electron pairs are present, including both bonding pairs and lone pairs. Treat both double and triple bonds as if they were single electron pairs. A is used to represent the central atom. B indicates atoms surrounding A. E indicates the number of lone electron pairs. Bond angles are predicted in the following order:</p>
<em><center>lone pair versus lone pair repulsion > lone pair versus bonding pair repulsion > bonding pair versus bonding pair repulsion</center></em>
<b> Quantum numbers </b>
<p>Chemistry is mostly the study of electron interactions between atoms and molecules. Understanding the behavior of the electrons in an atom is an important part of understanding chemical reactions. Early atomic theories used the idea that an atom's electron followed the same rules as a mini solar system where the planets were electrons orbiting a center proton sun. Electric attractive forces are much stronger than gravitational forces, but follow the same basic inverse square rules for distance. Early observations showed the electrons were moving more like a cloud surrounding the nucleus rather than an individual planet. The shape of the cloud, or orbital, depended on the amount of energy, angular momentum and magnetic moment of the individual electron. The properties of an atom's electron configuration are described by four quantum numbers: n, l, m, and s.

<p>The first is the energy level quantum number, n. In an orbit, lower energy orbits are close to the source of attraction. The more energy you give a body in orbit, the further 'out' it goes. If you give the body enough energy, it will leave the system entirely. The same is true for an electron orbital. Higher values of n mean more energy for the electron and the corresponding radius of the electron cloud or orbital is further away from the nucleus. Values of n start at 1 and go up by integer amounts. The higher the value of n, the closer the corresponding energy levels are to each other. If enough energy is added to the electron, it will leave the atom and leave a positive ion behind.

<p>The second quantum number is the angular quantum number, l. Each value of n has multiple values of l ranging in values from 0 to (n-1).This quantum number determines the 'shape' of the electron cloud. In chemistry, there are names for each values of l. The first value, l = 0 called an s orbital. s orbitals are spherical, centered on the nucleus. The second, l = 1 is called a p orbital. p orbitals are usually polar and form a teardrop petal shape with the point towards the nucleus. l = 2 orbital is called a d orbital. These orbitals are similar to the p orbital shape, but with more 'petals' like a clover leaf. They can also have ring shapes around the base of the petals. The next orbital, l=3 is called an f orbital. These orbitals tend to look similar to d orbitals, but with even more 'petals'. Higher values of l have names that follow in alphabetical order.

<p>The third quantum number is the magnetic quantum number, m. These numbers were first discovered in spectroscopy when the gaseous elements were exposed to a magnetic field. The spectral line corresponding to a particular orbit would split into multiple lines when a magnetic field would be introduced across the gas. The number of split lines would be related to the angular quantum number. This relationship shows for every value of l, a corresponding set of values of m ranging from -l to l is found. This number determines the orbital's orientation in space. For example, p orbitals correspond to l=1, can have m values of -1,0,1. This would represent three different orientations in space for the twin petals of the p orbital shape. They are usually defined to be px, py, pz to represent the axes they align with.

<p>The fourth quantum number is the spin quantum number, s. There are only two values for s, +½ and -½. These are also referred to as 'spin up' and 'spin down'. This number is used to explain behavior of individual electrons as if they were spinning in a clockwise or counterclockwise. The important part to orbitals is the fact that each value of m has two electrons and needed a way to distinguish them from one another.

<p>These four numbers, n, l, m and s can be used to describe any electron in a stable atom. Each electron's quantum numbers are unique and cannot be shared by another electron in that atom. This property is called the Pauli Exclusion Principle. A stable atom has as many electrons as it does protons. The rules the electrons follow to orient themselves around their atom are simple once the rules governing the quantum numbers are understood.

For review:
<ul>
 <li>   n can have whole number values: 1, 2, 3, ...</li>
<li>    For every value of n, l can have integer values from 0 to (n-1)</li>
   <li> m can have any whole number value, including zero, from -l to +l</li>
<li>    s can be either +½ or -½ </li>
