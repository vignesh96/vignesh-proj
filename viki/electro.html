<b> Rules for Assigning Oxidation Numbers</b>
<p> Electrochemical reactions involve the transfer of electrons. Mass and charge are conserved when balancing these reactions, but you need to know which atoms are oxidized and which atoms are reduced during the reaction. Oxidation numbers are used to keep track of how many electrons are lost or gained by each atom. These oxidation numbers are assigned using the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>   The convention is that the cation is written first in a formula, followed by the anion.</b>

   <p> For example, in NaH, the H is H<sup>-</sup>; in HCl, the H is H<sup>+</sup>.</p></li>

<li> <b>   The oxidation number of a free element is always 0.</b>

    <p>The atoms in He and N<sub>2</sub>, for example, have oxidation numbers of 0.</p></li>

<li><b>    The oxidation number of a monatomic ion equals the charge of the ion.</b>

   <p> For example, the oxidation number of Na+ is +1; the oxidation number of N<sup>3-</sup> is -3.</p></li>

<li><b>    The usual oxidation number of hydrogen is +1.</b>

   <p> The oxidation number of hydrogen is -1 in compounds containing elements that are less electronegative than hydrogen, as in CaH2.</p></li>

<li><b>    The oxidation number of oxygen in compounds is usually -2.</b>

<p>    Exceptions include OF<sub>2</sub>, since F is more electronegative than O, and BaO<sub>2</sub>, due to the structure of the peroxide ion, which is [O-O]<sup>2-</sup>.</p></li>

<li><b>    The oxidation number of a Group IA element in a compound is +1.</b></li><p>

   <li><b>The oxidation number of a Group IIA element in a compound is +2.</b></li></p>

<li><b>    The oxidation number of a Group VIIA element in a compound is -1, except when that element is combined with one having a higher electronegativity.</b>

   <p> The oxidation number of Cl is -1 in HCl, but the oxidation number of Cl is +1 in HOCl.</p></li>

<p><li><b>    The sum of the oxidation numbers of all of the atoms in a neutral compound is 0.</b></li></p>

<li>  <b>    The sum of the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion is equal to the charge of the ion.</b>

   <p> For example, the sum of the oxidation numbers for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is -2. </p></li>
</ul>

<b>  Balancing Redox Reactions </b>
<center> <img src="http://0.tqn.com/d/chemistry/1/0/S/0/1/redoxhalfreactions.jpg"></center>
<p>To balance redox reactions, assign oxidation numbers to the reactants and products to determine how many moles of each species are needed to conserve mass and charge. First, separate the equation into two half-reactions, the oxidation portion and the reduction portion. This is called the half-reaction method of balancing redox reactions or the ion-electron method. Each half-reaction is balanced separately and then the equations are added together to give a balanced overall reaction. We want the net charge and number of ions to be equal on both sides of the final balanced equation.

For this example, let's consider a redox reaction between KMnO<sub>4</sub>and HI in an acidic solution:<center>

MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>- </sup>+ I<sup>-</sup> --> I<sub>2</sub> + Mn<sup>2+</sup></center>
<br>
<b> Nernst equation </b>
<p>The Nernst equation is used to calculate the voltage of an electrochemical cell or to find the concentration of one of the components of the cell. Here is a look at the Nernst equation and an example of how to apply it to solve a problem.</p>
<b>The Nernst Equation</b>
<br>E<sub>cell</sub> = E<sup>0</sup><sub>cell</sub> - (RT/nF)lnQ

<br>E<sub>cell</sub> = cell potential under nonstandard conditions (V)
<br>E<sup>0</sup><sub>cell</sub> = cell potential under standard conditions
<br>R = gas constant, which is 8.31 (volt-coulomb)/(mol-K)
<br>T = temperature (K)
<br>n = number of moles of electrons exchanged in the electrochemical reaction (mol)
<br>F = Faraday's constant, 96500 coulombs/mol
<br>Q = reaction quotient, which is the equilibrium expression with initial concentrations rather than equilibrium concentrations
<p>
Sometimes it is helpful to express the Nernst equation differently:</p>

<center>E<sub>cell </sub>= E<sup>0</sup><sub>cell</sub> - (2.303*RT/nF)logQ<p>

at 298K, E<sub>cell</sub> = E<sup>0</sup><sub>cell</sub> - (0.0591 V/n)log Q</p>
<p>Nernst Equation Example</p>
<p>A zinc electrode is submerged in an acidic 0.80 M Zn<sup>2+</sup> solution which is connected by a salt bridge to a 1.30 M Ag<sup>+</sup> solution containing a silver electrode. Determine the initial voltage of the cell at 298K.</p>

<p>Unless you've done some serious memorizing, you'll need to consult the standard reduction potential table, which will give you the following information:</p>

<p>E<sup>0</sup><sub>red</sub>: Zn<sup>2+</sup><sub>aq</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup> ? ZnS = -0.76 V

</p><p>E<sup>0</sup>red: Ag<sup>+</sup><sub>aq</sub> + e<sup>-</sup> ? AgS= +0.80 V

</p>E<sub>cell</sub> = E<sup>0</sup><sub>cell</sub> - (0.0591 V/n)log Q

<p>Q = [Zn<sup>2+</sup>]/[Ag<sup>+</sup>]2

</p>The reaction proceeds spontaneously so E<sup>0</sup> is positive. The only way for that to occur is if Zn is oxidized (+0.76 V) and silver is reduced (+0.80 V). Once you realize that, you can write the balanced chemical equation for the cell reaction and can calculate E<sup>0</sup>:

<p>ZnS--> Zn<sop>2+</sup><sub>aq</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup> and E<sup>0</sup><sub>ox</sub> = +0.76 V

</p>2Ag<sup>+</sup><sub>aq</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> 2AgS and E<sup>0</sup><sub>red</sub> = +0.80 V

<p>which are added together to yield:

</p>ZnS + 2Ag<sup>+</sup><sub>aq</sub> -->Zn<sup>2+</sup><sub>a</sub> + 2AgS with E<sup>0</sup> = 1.56 V

<p>Now, applying the Nernst equation:

</p>Q = (0.80)/(1.30)<sup>2</sup>

<p>Q = (0.80)/(1.69)

</p>Q = 0.47

<p>E = 1.56 V - (0.0591 / 2)log(0.47)

<p>E = 1.57 V</center>
<br>
<b>Electrochemical Cells</b>
<p>Oxidation-reduction or redox reactions take place in electrochemical cells. There are two types of electrochemical cells. Spontaneous reactions occur in galvanic (voltaic) cells; nonspontaneous reactions occur in electrolytic cells. Both types of cells contain electrodes where the oxidation and reduction reactions occur. Oxidation occurs at the electrode termed the anode and reduction occurs at the electrode called the cathode.</p>

<b>Electrodes & Charge</b>

<p>The anode of an electrolytic cell is positive (cathode is negative), since the anode attracts anions from the solution. However, the anode of a galvanic cell is negatively charged, since the spontaneous oxidation at the anode is the source of the cell's electrons or negative charge. The cathode of a galvanic cell is its positive terminal. In both galvanic and electrolytic cells, oxidation takes place at the anode and electrons flow from the anode to the cathode. </p>
