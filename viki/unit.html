<h4 style="color:#191970"> Significant figures </h4>
Specifically, the rules for identifying significant figures when writing or interpreting numbers are as follows:
<ul>
<li>    All non-zero digits are considered significant. For example, 91 has two significant figures (9 and 1), while 123.45 has five significant figures (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).</li>
<li>    Zeros appearing anywhere between two non-zero digits are significant. Example: 101.1203 has seven significant figures: 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0 and 3.</li>
<li>    Leading zeros are not significant. For example, 0.00052 has two significant figures: 5 and 2.</li>
<li>    Trailing zeros in a number containing a decimal point are significant. For example, 12.2300 has six significant figures: 1, 2, 2, 3, 0 and 0. The number 0.000122300 still has only six significant figures (the zeros before the 1 are not significant). In addition, 120.00 has five significant figures since it has three trailing zeros. This convention clarifies the precision of such numbers; for example, if a measurement precise to four decimal places (0.0001) is given as 12.23 then it might be understood that only two decimal places of precision are available. Stating the result as 12.2300 makes clear that it is precise to four decimal places (in this case, six significant figures).</li>
<li>    The significance of trailing zeros in a number not containing a decimal point can be ambiguous. For example, it may not always be clear if a number like 1300 is precise to the nearest unit (and just happens coincidentally to be an exact multiple of a hundred) or if it is only shown to the nearest hundred due to rounding or uncertainty. Various conventions exist to address this issue:</li>

<li>        A bar may be placed over the last significant figure; any trailing zeros following this are insignificant. For example, 1300 has three significant figures (and hence indicates that the number is precise to the nearest ten).</li>

<li>        The last significant figure of a number may be underlined; for example, "2000" has two significant figures.</li>

<li>        A decimal point may be placed after the number; for example "100." indicates specifically that three significant figures are meant.</li>

<li>        In the combination of a number and a unit of measurement, the ambiguity can be avoided by choosing a suitable unit prefix. For example, the number of significant figures in a mass specified as 1300 g is ambiguous, while in a mass of 13 h?g or 1.3 kg it is not.</li>
</ul>
    However, these conventions are not universally used, and it is often necessary to determine from context whether such trailing zeros are intended to be significant. If all else fails, the level of rounding can be specified explicitly. The abbreviation s.f. is sometimes used, for example "20 000 to 2 s.f." or "20 000 (2 sf)". Alternatively, the uncertainty can be stated separately and explicitly with a plus-minus sign, as in 20 000 ± 1%, so that significant-figures rules do not apply. This also allows specifying a precision in-between powers of ten (or whatever the base power of the numbering system is). </li>

<h4> Scientific notation </h4>
Scientific notation (commonly referred to as "standard form") is a way of writing numbers that are too big or too small to be conveniently written in decimal form. Scientific notation has a number of useful properties and is commonly used in calculators and by scientists, mathematicians and engineers.

In scientific notation all numbers are written in the form of

  <br><center><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/2/8/c28d1c9f6e047e3b93030bf39fe60e5b.png"></center><br>

(a times ten raised to the power of b), where the exponent b is an integer, and the coefficient a is any real number (however, see normalized notation below), called the significand or mantissa. The term "mantissa" may cause confusion, however, because it can also refer to the fractional part of the common logarithm. If the number is negative then a minus sign precedes a (as in ordinary decimal notation).
Decimal floating point is a computer arithmetic system closely related to scientific notation.

<h4> Mean </h4>
It's very important to know how to calculate the mean or average of a set of numbers. Among other things, this will allow you to calculate your grade point average. However, you'll need to calculate the mean for several other situations, too.
The Mean or Average
In general, you caculate the mean or average of a set of numbers by adding them all up and divding by how many numbers you have. This can be defined as follows:

For a set of numbers, {x1, x2, x3, ... xj} the mean or average is the sum of all "x" divided by "j".
Worked Examples of Calculating the Mean
Let's start with an easy example. Calculate the mean of the following set of numbers:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5

To do this, add up the numbers and divide by how many numbers you have (5 of them, in this case).

mean = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)/5

mean = 15/5

mean = 3

Pretty easy, right? Here's another example of calculating the mean.

<br><center>Calculate the mean of the following set of numbers:

25, 28, 31, 35, 43, 48</center>

How many numbers are there? 6<br> So, add together all of the numbers and divide the total by 6 in order to get the mean.

mean = (25 + 28 + 31 + 35 + 43 + 48)/6

<br>=>mean = 210/6

<br>=>mean = 35

<h4> Metric units </h4>
The metric system is a system of units of measurement established from its beginnings in 1874 by diplomatic treaty to the more modern General Conference on Weights and Measures - CGPM (Conferérence Générale des Poids et Measures). The modern system is actually called the International System of Units or SI. SI is abbreviated from the French Le Système International d'Unités and grew from the original metric system. Today, most people use the name metric and SI interchangeably with SI being the more correct title.

<br>SI or metric is considered the main system of measurement units used in science today. Each unit is considered to be dimensionally independent from each other. These dimensions are described as the measurements of length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, amount of a substance, and luminous intensity. This list has the current definitions of each of the seven base units.

<b>    Length - Meter ( m )</b>

    The meter is the SI unit of length. The meter is defined by the length of the path light travels in a vacuum during 1/299 792 458 of a second.

<br><b>    Mass - Kilogram ( kg )</b>
<p>    The kilogram is the SI unit of mass. It is the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram.
    There is a standard platinum/iridium 1 kg mass housed near Paris at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM).

<b> <br>   Time - Second ( s )</b>
    <p>The basic unit of time is the second. The second is defined to be the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the cesium-133 atomic ground state.

<b> <br>   Electric Current - Ampere ( A )</b>
    <p>The basic unit of electric current is the ampere. The ampere is defined to be that constant current which, if maintained in two infinitely long straight parallel conductors which have negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 m apart in vacuum, would produce between a force between the conductors equal to 2 x 10-7 newton per meter of length.

<b><br>    Temperature - Kelvin ( K )</b>
   <p> The kelvin is the unit of thermodynamic temperature. It is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.

<b><br>    Amount of a Substance - Mole ( mol )</b>
    <p>The mole is defined to be the amount of a substance which contains as many entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilograms of carbon-12. When the mole unit is used, the entities must be specified. For example, the entities may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, cows, houses, or anything else.

<b><br>    Luminous Intensity - candela ( cd )</b>
 <p>   The unit of luminous intensity, or light, is the candela. The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source emitting monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 x 1012 hertz with radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.

<br><br>Reading through this list, it is easy to see that these definitions are actually methods to realize the unit. Each realization was created with a unique and sound theoretical base to generate reproducible and accurate results.	
<h4> Metric to metric conversions </h4>
<img src="http://0.tqn.com/d/chemistry/1/5/6/g/g2kg1.jpg"><br>
Unit cancellation is one of the easiest ways to keep control of your units in any science problem. This example converts grams to kilograms. It doesn't matter what the units are, the process is the same.

Question: How many kilograms are in 1,532 grams?

The graphic shows seven steps to convert grams to kilograms.
<p>Step A shows the relationship between kilograms and grams.

<p>In Step B, both sides of the equation are divided by 1000 g.

<p>Step C shows how the value of 1 kg/1000 g is the equal to the number 1. This step is important in the unit cancellation method. When you multiply a number or variable by 1, the value is unchanged.

<p>Step D restates the example problem.

<p>In Step E, multiply both sides of the equation by 1 and substitute the left side's 1 with the value in step C.

<p>Step F is the unit cancellation step. The gram unit from the top (or numerator) of the fraction is canceled from the bottom (or denominator) leaving only the kilogram unit.

<p>Dividing 1536 by 1000 yields the final answer in step G.

<p>The final answer is: <em><b>There are 1.536 kg in 1536 grams</b></em>.
<h4> Temperature conversions </h4>
This worked example problem demonstrates how to convert Fahrenheit measurements to the Celsius and Kelvin temperature scales.

Problem:

Express normal body temperature, 98.6°F, in °C and K.

<p>Solution

<p>The Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion equation may be expressed in this form:
<br>F° = = 1.8(°C) + 32
<br>Enter 98,6 for the F°
<br>98.6 = 1.8(°C) + 32
<br>1.8(°C) = 98.6 - 32
<br>1.8(°C) = 66.6
<br>°C = 66.6/1.8
<br>°C = 37.0

<p>To solve for Kelvin:
<br>K = °C +273
<br>K = 37.0 + 273
<br>K = 310</p>

Answer

98.6 °F is equal to 37.0°C and 310 K
<h4> Pressure conversions </h4>
Problem
<br>
A radio station announcer reports the atmospheric pressure to be 99.6 kPa. What is the pressure in atmospheres? In millimeters of mercury?
<p>
Solution
<br>
Look up conversions factors in a table to convert between kilopascals and atmospheres and millimeters of mercury. Use a conversion factor approach to solve the problem:

99.6 kPa x 1 atm/101.3 kPa = 0.983 atm

0.983 atm x 760 mm Hg/1 atm = 747 mm Hg
</p>
<p>Answer

0.983 atm; 747 mm Hg
