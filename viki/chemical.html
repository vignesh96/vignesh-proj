<b>Types of Chemical Bonds </b>
<p>Atoms are the basic building blocks of all types of matter. Atoms link to other atoms through chemicals bonds resulting from the strong attractive forces that exist between the atoms.</p>

<p>So what exactly is a chemical bond? It is a region that forms when electrons from different atoms interact with each other. The electrons that participate in chemical bonds are the valence electrons, which are the electrons found in an atom's outermost shell. When two atoms approach each other these outer electrons interact. Electrons repel each other, yet they are attracted to the protons within atoms. The interplay of forces results in some atoms forming bonds with each other and sticking together.</p>

<p>The two main types of bonds formed between atoms are ionic bonds and covalent bonds. An ionic bond is formed when one atom accepts or donates one or more of its valence electrons to another atom. A covalent bond is formed when atoms share valence electrons. The atoms do not always share the electrons equally, so a polar covalent bond may be the result. When electrons are shared by two metallic atoms a metallic bond may be formed. In a covalent bond, electrons are shared between two atoms. The electrons that participate in metallic bonds may be shared between any of the metal atoms in the region.</p>

If the electronegativity values of two atoms are:
<ul>
<li>   similar...</li>
<li> Metallic bonds form between two metal atoms.</li>
<li> Covalent bonds form between two non-metal atoms.</li>
<li> Nonpolar covalent bonds form when the electronegativity values are very similar.</li>
<li>Polar covalent bonds form when the electronegativity values are a little further apart.</li> 
<li>different...</li>
<li> Ionic bonds are formed. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<b> Electronegativity and Chemical Bonding </b>
<p>Electronegativity is a measure of the attraction of an atom for the electrons in a chemical bond. The higher the electronegativity of an atom, the greater its attraction for bonding electrons.</p>
<b>Electronegativity and Ionization Energy</b>
<p>Electronegativity is related to ionization energy. Electrons with low ionization energies have low electronegativities because their nuclei do not exert a strong attractive force on electrons. Elements with high ionization energies have high electronegativities due to the strong pull exerted on electrons by the nucleus.</p>
<b>Electronegativity and Periodic Table Trends</b>
<p>In an element group, the electronegativity decreases as atomic number increases, as a result of increased distance between the valence electron and nucleus (greater atomic radius). An example of an electropositive (i.e., low electronegativity) element is cesium; an example of a highly electronegative element is fluorine.</p>
<ul>
<li>    Moving left to right across the periodic table, electronegativity increases.</li>

<li>    Moving top to bottom down the periodic table, elctronegativity decreases. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Valences of the Elements</b>
<p>You may assume that the valences of the elements are those which can be derived by looking at the Groups (columns) of the Periodic Table. While these are the most common valences, the real behavior of electrons is less simple. Here is a table of element valences. Remember that an element's electron cloud will become more stable by filling, emptying, or half-filling the shell. Also, shells don't stack neatly one on top of another, so don't always assume an element's valence is determined by the number of electrons in its outer shell. </p>
<br>
<b>Lewis Structures or Electron Dot Structures</b>
<p>Lewis structures are also known as electron dot structures. The diagrams are named for Gilbert N. Lewis, who described them in his 1916 article entitled The Atom and the Molecule. Lewis structures depict the bonds between atoms of a molecule as well as any unbonded electron pairs. You can draw a Lewis dot structure for any covalent molecule or coordination compound.</p>



<p>A Lewis structure is a type of shorthand notation. Atoms are written using their element symbols. Lines are drawn between atoms to indicate chemical bonds. Single lines are single bonds. Double lines are double bonds. Triple lines are triple bonds. (Sometimes pairs of dots are used instead of lines, but this is uncommon.) Dots are drawn next to atoms to show unbonded electrons. A pair of dots is a pair of excess electrons.</p>

<b>Steps to Drawing a Lewis Structure</b>
<ol>
<li>    Pick a Central Atom</li>

    Start your structure by picking a central atom and writing its element symbol. This atom will be the one with the lowest electronegativity. Sometimes it's difficult to know which atom is the least electronegative, but you can use the periodic table trends to help you out. Electronegativity typically increases as you move from left to right across the periodic table and decreases as you move down the table, from top to bottom. You can consult a table of electronegativities, but be aware different tables may give you slightly different values, since electronegativity is calculated.

    Once you have selected the central atom, write it down and connect the other atoms to it with a single bond. You may change these bonds to become double or triple bonds as you progress.

<li>    Count Electrons</li>

    Lewis electron dot structures show the valence electrons for each atom. You don't need to worry about the total number of electrons, only those in the the outer shells. The octet rule states that atoms with 8 electrons in their outer shell are stable. This rule applies well up to period 4, when it takes 18 electrons to fill the outer orbitals. 32 electrons are required to fill the outer orbitals of electrons from period 6. However, most of the time you are asked to draw a Lewis structure, you can stick with the octet rule.

<li>    Place Electrons around Atoms</li>

    Once you have determined how many electrons to draw around each atom, start placing them on the structure. Start by placing one pair of dots for each pair of valence electrons. Once the lone pairs are placed, you may find some atoms, particularly the central atom, don't have a complete octet of electrons. This indicates there are double or possibly triple bonds. Remember, it takes a pair of electrons to form a bond.

    Once the electrons have been placed, put brackets around the entire structure. If there is a charge on the molecule, write it as a superscript on the upper right, outside of the bracket.
