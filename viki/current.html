<h3 align="center"> Electric current </h3>
<br>
<b>Electric current  </b>
<p>Current is a rate quantity. There are several rate quantities in physics. For instance, velocity is a rate quantity - the rate at which an object changes its position. Mathematically, velocity is the position change per time ratio. Acceleration is a rate quantity - the rate at which an object changes its velocity. Mathematically, acceleration is the velocity change per time ratio. And power is a rate quantity - the rate at which work is done on an object. Mathematically, power is the work per time ratio. In every case of a rate quantity, the mathematical equation involves some quantity over time. Thus, current as a rate quantity would be expressed mathematically as<p align="center"><img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circuits/u9l2c2.gif"></p>

<p>Note that the equation above uses the symbol <em>I </em>to represent the quantity current.</p>

 The standard metric unit for current is the ampere. Ampere is often shortened to Amp and is abbreviated by the unit symbol A. A current of 1 ampere means that there is 1 coulomb of charge passing through a cross section of a wire every 1 second.
 
1 ampere = 1 coulomb / 1 second

To test your understanding, determine the current for the following two situations. Note that some extraneous information is given in each situation.<b><center> Test yourself</center></b>

<b> Electric field</b>
<p>
Perhaps one of the most useful yet taken-for-granted accomplishments of the recent centuries is the development of electric circuits. The flow of charge through wires allows us to cook our food, light our homes, air-condition our work and living space, entertain us with movies and music and even allows us to drive to work or school safely. In this unit of The Physics Classroom, we will explore the reasons for why charge flows through wires of electric circuits and the variables that affect the rate at which it flows. The means by which moving charge delivers electrical energy to appliances in order to operate them will be discussed in detail.
</p><p>
One of the fundamental principles that must be understood in order to grasp electric circuits pertains to the concept of how an electric field can influence charge within a circuit as it moves from one location to another. The concept of electric field was first introduced in the unit on Static Electricity. In that unit, electric force was described as a non-contact force. A charged balloon can have an attractive affect upon an oppositely charged balloon even when they are not in contact. The electric force acts over the distance separating the two objects. Electric force is an action-at-a-distance force.
</p>
<p>Action-at-a-distance forces are sometimes referred to as field forces. The concept of a field force is utilized by scientists to explain this rather unusual force phenomenon that occurs in the absence of physical contact. The space surrounding a charged object is affected by the presence of the charge; an electric field is established in that space. A charged object creates an electric field - an alteration of the space or field in the region that surrounds it. Other charges in that field would feel the unusual alteration of the space. Whether a charged object enters that space or not, the electric field exists. Space is altered by the presence of a charged object; other objects in that space experience the strange and mysterious qualities of the space. As another charged object enters the space and moves deeper and deeper into the field, the affect of the field becomes more and more noticeable.
</p>
<p>Electric field is a vector quantity whose direction is defined as the direction that a positive test charge would be pushed when placed in the field. Thus, the electric field direction about a positive source charge is always directed away from the positive source. And the electric field direction about a negative source charge is always directed toward the negative source.

<b> Electric potential </b>
<p>Electric potential energy has a dependency upon the charge of the object experiencing the electric field, electric potential is purely location dependent. Electric potential is the potential energy per charge.
</p><p align="center"> <img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circuits/u9l1b4.gif"></p><br>
The concept of electric potential is used to express the affect of an electric field of a source in terms of the location within the electric field. A test charge with twice the quantity of charge would possess twice the potential energy at a given location; yet its electric potential at that location would be the same as any other test charge. A positive test charge would be at a high electric potential when held close to a positive source charge and at a lower electric potential when held further away. In this sense, electric potential becomes simply a property of the location within an electric field. Suppose that the electric potential at a given location is 12 Joules per coulomb, then that is the electric potential of a 1 coulomb or a 2 coulomb charged object. Stating that the electric potential at a given location is 12 Joules per coulomb, would mean that a 2 coulomb object would possess 24 Joules of potential energy at that location and a 0.5 coulomb object would experience 6 Joules of potential energy at the location.<p> It depends on-
<ul><li>  Electric charge - a property of the object experiencing the electrical field</li><li>  Distance from source - the location within the electric field</li></ul>

<br> <b> Ohm's Law </b>
<p>he predominant equation which pervades the study of electric circuits is the equation
<center> <b>V = I • R</b></center>

<p>In words, the electric potential difference between two points on a circuit (V) is equivalent to the product of the current between those two points (I) and the total resistance of all electrical devices present between those two points (R). Through the rest of this unit of The Physics Classroom, this equation will become the most common equation which we see. Often referred to as the Ohm's law equation, this equation is a powerful predictor of the relationship between potential difference, current and resistance.</p>
<p>The Ohm's law equation can be rearranged and expressed as
 
<p align="center"> <img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circuits/u9l3c1.gif"></p>
As an equation, this serves as an algebraic recipe for calculating the current if the electric potential difference and the resistance are known. Yet while this equation serves as a powerful recipe for problem solving, it is much more than that. This equation indicates the two variables that would affect the amount of current in a circuit. The current in a circuit is directly proportional to the electric potential difference impressed across its ends and inversely proportional to the total resistance offered by the external circuit. The greater the battery voltage (i.e., electric potential difference), the greater the current. And the greater the resistance, the less the current. Charge flows at the greatest rates when the battery voltage is increased and the resistance is decreased. In fact, a twofold increase in the battery voltage would lead to a twofold increase in the current (if all other factors are kept equal). And an increase in the resistance of the load by a factor of two would cause the current to decrease by a factor of two to one-half its original value..</p>
<br>
<b> Circuits </b>
<p> In a series circuit, each device is connected in a manner such that there is only one pathway by which charge can traverse the external circuit. Each charge passing through the loop of the external circuit will pass through each resistor in consecutive fashion.</p>
<p>Charge flows together through the external circuit at a rate that is everywhere the same. The current is no greater at one location as it is at another location. The actual amount of current varies inversely with the amount of overall resistance. There is a clear relationship between the resistance of the individual resistors and the overall resistance of the collection of resistors. As far as the battery that is pumping the charge is concerned, the presence of two 6- resistors in series would be equivalent to having one 12- resistor in the circuit. The presence of three 6- resistors in series would be equivalent to having one 18- resistor in the circuit. And the presence of four 6- resistors in series would be equivalent to having one 24- resistor in the circuit.

This is the concept of equivalent resistance. The equivalent resistance of a circuit is the amount of resistance that a single resistor would need in order to equal the overall affect of the collection of resistors that are present in the circuit. For series circuits, the mathematical formula for computing the equivalent resistance (R<sub>eq</sub>) is
 <p align="center"><img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circuits/u9l4c2.gif"></p>
<p align="center">R<sub>eq</sub> = R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2 </sub>+ R<sub>3</sub> + ...</p>

where R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>3</sub> are the resistance values of the individual resistors that are connected in series.
<br>
<p>In a parallel circuit, charge divides up into separate branches such that there can be more current in one branch than there is in another. Nonetheless, when taken as a whole, the total amount of current in all the branches when added together is the same as the amount of current at locations outside the branches. The rule that current is everywhere the same still works, only with a twist. The current outside the branches is the same as the sum of the current in the individual branches. It is still the same amount of current, only split up into more than one pathway.
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circuits/u9l4d12.gif"></p>
In equation form, this principle can be written as
 
I<sub>total</sub> = I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>3</sub> + ...

where I<sub>total</sub> is the total amount of current outside the branches (and in the battery) and I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, and I<sub>3</sub> represent the current in the individual branches of the circuit.
<p>For parallel circuits, the mathematical formula for computing the equivalent resistance (R<sub>eq</sub>) is
 
1 / R<sub>eq</sub> = 1 / R<sub>1</sub> + 1 / R<sub>2</sub> + 1 / R<sub>3</sub> + ...

where R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>3</sub> are the resistance values of the individual resistors that are connected in parallel.</p>
