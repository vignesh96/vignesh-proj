<b> Balancing Chemical Equations </b>
<p>A chemical equation describes what happens in a chemical reaction. The equation identifies the reactants (starting materials) and products (resulting substance), the formulas of the participants, the phases of the participants (solid, liquid, gas), and the amount of each substance. Balancing a chemical equation refers to establishing the mathematical relationship between the quantity of reactants and products. The quantities are expressed as grams or moles.</p>

<p>It takes practice to be able to write balanced equations. There are essentially three steps to the process:<p>
<ol>
<li><b>    Write the unbalanced equation.</b></li>

<ul>     
 <li>       Chemical formulas of reactants are listed on the lefthand side of the equation.</li>
  <li>      Products are listed on the righthand side of the equation.</li>
   <li>     Reactants and products are separated by putting an arrow between them to show the direction of the reaction. Reactions at equilibrium will have arrows facing both directions.</li>
</ul>
     
<li><b>    Balance the equation.</b></li>
<ul>
<li>        Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass to get the same number of atoms of every element on each side of the equation. Tip: Start by balancing an element that appears in only one reactant and product.</li>
<li>        Once one element is balanced, proceed to balance another, and another, until all elements are balanced.</li>
 <li>       Balance chemical formulas by placing coefficients in front of them. Do not add subscripts, because this will change the formulas.</li>
</ul> 
    
<li><b>    Indicate the states of matter of the reactants and products.</b></li>
<ul>
<li>        Use (g) for gaseous substances.</li>
 <li>       Use (s) for solids.</li>
 <li>       Use (l) for liquids.</li>
 <li>       Use (aq) for species in solution in water.</li>
<li>  Write the state of matter immediately following the formula of the substance it describes.</b></li>
</ul></ol><br>
<b>Factors that Affect the Chemical Reaction Rate</b> 
<p>It's useful to be able to predict whether an action will affect the rate at which a chemical reaction proceeds. There are several factors that can influence the rate of a chemical reaction. In general, a factor that increases the number of collisions between particles will increase the reaction rate and a factor that decreases the number of collisions between particles will decrease the chemical reaction rate.</p>

<b>Concentration of Reactants</b>
<p>
A higher concentration of reactants leads to more effective collisions per unit time, which leads to an increasing reaction rate (except for zero order reactions). Similarly, a higher concentation of products tends to be associated with a lower reaction rate. Use the partial pressure of reactants in a gaseous state as a measure of their concentration.
</p>
<b>Temperature</b>
<p>Usually, an increase in temperature is accompanied by an increase in the reaction rate. Temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of a system, so higher temperature implies higher average kinetic energy of molecules and more collisions per unit time. A general rule of thumb for most (not all) chemical reactions is that the rate at which the reaction proceeds will approximately double for each 10°C increase in temperature. Once the temperature reaches a certain point, some of the chemical species may be altered (e.g., denaturing of proteins) and the chemical reaction will slow or stop.</p>
<b>Medium</b>
<p>The rate of a chemical reaction depends on the medium in which the reaction occurs. It may make a difference whether a medium is aqueous or organic; polar or nonpolar; or liquid, solid, or gaseous.</p>
<b>Presence of Catalysts and Competitors</b>
<p>Catalysts (e.g., enzymes) lower the activation energy of a chemical reaction and increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. Catalysts work by increasing the frequency of collisions between reactants, altering the orientation of reactants so that more collisions are effective, reducing intramolecular bonding within reactant molecules, or donating electron density to the reactants. The presence of a catalyst helps a reaction to proceed more quickly to equilibrium. Aside from catalysts, other chemical species can affect a reaction. The quantity of hydrogen ions (the pH of aqueous solutions) can alter a reaction rate. Other chemical species may compete for a reactant or alter orientation, bonding, electron density, etc., thereby decreasing the rate of a reaction.</p>

<b> Law of Multiple Proportions Problem </b>
<p>Two different compounds are formed by the elements carbon and oxygen. The first compound contains 42.9% by mass carbon and 57.1% by mass oxygen. The second compound contains 27.3% by mass carbon and 72.7% by mass oxygen. Show that the data are consistent with the Law of Multiple Proportions.</p>
<br>
Solution<p>

The Law of Multiple Proportions is the third postulate of Dalton's atomic theory. It states that the masses of one element which combine with a fixed mass of the second element are in a ratio of whole numbers.</p>

Therefore, the masses of oxygen in the two compounds that combine with a fixed mass of carbon should be in a whole-number ratio. In 100 g of the first compound (100 is chosen to make calculations easier) there are 57.1 g O and 42.9 g C. <p>The mass of O per gram C is:

</p><p align="center">57.1 g O / 42.9 g C = 1.33 g O per g C

</p>In the 100 g of the second compound, there are 72.7 g O and 27.3 g C. The mass of oxygen per gram of carbon is:

<p align="center">72.7 g O / 27.3 g C = 2.66 g O per g C

</p>Dividing the mass O per g C of the second (larger value) compound:

<p align="center">2.66 / 1.33 = 2

</p>Which mean that the masses of oxygen that combine with carbon are in a 2:1 ratio. The whole-number ratio is consistent with the Law of Multiple Proportions.
<br>
<b>Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield</b>
<p>The limiting reactant of a reaction is the reactant that would run out first if all the reactants were to be reacted together. Once the limiting reactant is completely consumed, the reaction would cease to progress. The theoretic yield of a reaction is the amount of products produced when the limiting reactant runs out. This worked example chemistry problem shows how to determine the limiting reactant and calculate the theoretical yield of a chemical reaction.</p>
<br>
<b>Chemical Reaction Orders </b>
<p>Chemical reactions can be classified based on their reaction kinetics. The general reaction form is:</p>

<center>aA + bB ? cC + dD</center>

<p>Reactions are categorized as zero-order, first-order, second-order, or mixed-order (higher-order) reactions.</p>

<p><b>    Zero-Order Reactions</b>

    Zero-order reactions (order = 0) have a constant rate. This rate is independent of the concentration of the reactants. The rate law is:

<center>    rate = k</center>, with k having the units of M/sec.

</p><b>    First-Order Reactions</b>

    A first order reaction (order = 1) has a rate proportional to the concentration of one of the reactants. A common example of a first-order reaction is the phenomenon of radioactive decay. The rate law is:

<center>    rate = k[A] (or B instead of A),</center> with k having the units of sec-1

<p><b>    Second-Order Reactions</b>

    A second-order reaction (order = 2) has a rate proportional to the concentration of the square of a single reactant or the product of the concentration of two reactants:

<center>    rate = k[A]<sup>2</sup> </center>(or substitute B for A or k multiplied by the concentration of A times the concentration of B), with the units of the rate constant M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup>

</p>  <b>  Mixed-Order or Higher-Order Reactions</b>

    Mixed-order reactions have a fractional order for their rate:

<center>    e.g., rate = k[A]<sup>1/3</sup></center>
