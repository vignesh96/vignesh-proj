</p><br> The following definitions are certainly not the final word on any of these terms, but may help give an idea of what we mean when we refer to them in this website and in our programs:
<br><br>
<h3> Science </h3>
<br><br>
The defining feature of our programs is the use of science as the process by which we gain the insights about the world that we use in helping us see how we fit in. So what distinguishes science from other ways of knowing about the world? Here's one attempt to get a handle on this:<br><br>
The word science refers both to a process for obtaining knowledge about the world, and to a set of insights about the world which have been built up through this process. Our definition thus has two components:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>  Science is the process by which we invent possible explanations (theories) describing what we observe in nature, and then filter out explanations that work from those that do not work by testing (through experiment and observation) the predictions they make about what else we will observe. Two key features characterizing this approach are the important role of observation (disagreements are ultimately to be settled by experiment and observation; nature has the last word) and the search for unifying principles that attempt to connect many different phenomena with as few explanations as possible.</li>
<li> Science also refers to the body of knowledge produced by this inquiry process.</li>
<br>
For a standard definition of science endorsed by various professional organizations, see the statement, What is Science? by the American Association of Physics Teachers.<br>
<h3> Personal worldview </h3>
<br>
The mental map by which we each view our relationship to the world, and which guides our choices and actions through the perspective it gives us on our individual role as part of the universe.<br>
<h3> Science Integration </h3>
<br>
The process by which insights from science are incorporated or assimilated into a person's personal worldview.<br>
<h3> Meaning </h3>
<br>
A context within which our choices and actions are significant, so that what we do truly matters in some way.<br>
